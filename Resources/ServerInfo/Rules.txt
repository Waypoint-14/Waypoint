    - Administrators will be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.
    - All of these rules apply as they are intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.
	
[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] GameMasters are in charge of the rounds' narrative direction, you are expected to co-operate with them where necessary should you be participating to any degree in events; whether as an actor or just someone involved.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP), erotic content, or 18+ sexual content is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color]. This includes comments not explicitly sexual in nature that contain words, phrases, or ideations that are deemed inappropriate. [color=#ff0000]If roleplay reaches a point where it has become sexual and/or uncomfortable, immediately stop and contact an administrator.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow the server expectations
    - Do not cheat.
    - Do not abuse glitches and exploits. [color=#ff0000]We have zero tolerance for abusing exploits/bugs. If you’re not sure, ask an admin.[/color]
    - If you are banned from a role or department, you may not play that role. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from.
    - Do not make yourself a major problem for the crew without cause.
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for one specific crew member in a way that would actively detract from the other player's enjoyment of the shift.
    - Department strikes (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden. These activities are generally antagonist-only and all players regardless of antagonist status must obtain admin Central Command permission before engaging in this behavior (you are extremely unlikely to get permission).

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Follow Chat Guidelines
    - Use English as your primary method of communication.
    - Do not spam.
    - Do not advertise.
    - Be respectful towards other players in LOOC and OOC channels, and avoid making others uncomfortable. This can range anywhere from starting arguments to personal attacks against others, depending on the context.
    - Do not use netspeak in character (i.e. btw, lmfao).
    - Do not use the Emotes channel to bypass an inability to speak. This includes examples like "motions for you to put parmesan THEN sauce on the spaghetti," "im friendly," and "huh weird looks like I can't type."
    - Use the LOOC and OOC channels properly. Don’t speak of in-character matters in those channels unless you’re asking questions related to in-game concepts.
       * DO NOT use in-character channels to bypass a lack of ability to use OOC/LOOC chats (e.g. "Huh, wonder where captain went? *OOC* He probably left to get dinner lol"). This will result in an immediate dewhitelist.
    - Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color]. Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Follow Metagaming guidelines
    - If you die and get revived, do not act on things you saw while you were dead.
    - Do not engage in meta-communications. This includes using chat channels outside of what is available in-game to communicate with other players in the same game.
    - Players are allowed to have in-character relationships (friends, enemies, or otherwise).
    - You are allowed to have knowledge of past experiences with someone else in prior shifts. This does not give you permission to hold a grudge against someone that results in you treating them differently in an unfair way (i.e. Meta-Grudging).
    - Specific players who were antagonists in previous rounds must not be treated differently because of it.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] If a player dies and is brought back from death, they forget the last five minutes leading up to their death and cannot describe who or what killed them aside from vague details.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Follow Naming Conventions
    - In-character names must fit the server standards of:
        * Doesn't make references.
        * Doesn't disturb roleplay.
		* Follows any naming conventions for the species, if those exist.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Follow Roleplay Guidelines
    - You are playing a character; you are the puppetmaster with their strings. You are expected to participate in the story, and co-operatively develop it with fellow players.
    - Character development and memories can carry over between rounds; however you are never to remember whether someone was previously a hostile operative, nor if you/someone died, nor the station destroyed.
    - Command and Security will be held to a higher standard for roleplay; due to their higher impact on the round.
	- You are expected to reasonably follow IC guidelines; your character is often reasonable and not a troublemaker. You would not have made it aboard otherwise.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Follow Escalation Guidelines
    - Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Follow Antagonist Guidelines
    - The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. However antagonists have leniency in regards to what they can and can’t do.  If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin.
    - Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs or zombies.
    - Exploits, arrivals camping, unnecessary round extensions, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.
    - Ghost roles have their own independent rules that must be followed. [color=#ff0000]Breaking these rules can result in a ban, whitelist removal, or both.[/color]
	- The GameMaster will assign objectives to antagonists
	- Antagonists are encouraged to create their own IC backstory; however are encouraged to ahelp regarding assigned objectives or backstory.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other than to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").
    - A medical doctor does not need insulated gloves, nor a toolbelt, and the Head of Personnel does not need to give themselves armory access so they can go grab a gun.
    - Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or deadly poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.
    - Don't preemptively hide antagonist objectives or preemptively secure them with higher security than normally required.
    - Don't manufacture or prepare things for the "end of the round" when the shuttle docks with Central Command.

[color=#ff0000]SECURITY & COMMAND RULES[/color]
These rules apply to any individual who is promoted or is acting in the place of a Security/Command role (unless they are an antagonist).

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Security and command roles are held to a higher standard and should follow IC regulations.
    - If you need to leave your computer, send an ahelp or notify your fellow crew via the radio.
    - Be competent in your job and department.
    - Security and Command roles are forbidden from using an uplink. You do not know how to operate it; nor it's contents.
    - Do not give away your objective items (e.g. Captain’s equipment, Head of Personnel’s ID, etc.). Some leeway is given to making deals with criminals if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the station as a whole and not just yourself.
    - Uphold the Law & maintain order. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior. Security is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible. Heads of Staff are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to Security.
    - Do not immediately abandon your position as a Command role and go do whatever you want instead of managing your department/the station.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Security (and Command where applicable) should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests. Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items not reasonably required by a crew member during their detention, or during their service aboard the station (toolbelt, insulated gloves, etc).
    - Security is prohibited from checking crewmates for implants without reasonable suspicion.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Command members are not permitted to leave on expeditions.
